SQL Project
Utilized Microsoft SQL Server to analyze pizza sales data from a pizza store. 
The dataset comprised four interconnected tables: Orders, Order Details, Pizza Details, and Pizza Types. 
By querying and joining these tables, I derived actionable insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and inventory management. 
Key findings included popular pizza types, peak order times, and revenue patterns. 
The analysis enabled the pizza shop to optimize their menu offerings, improve inventory planning, and enhance marketing strategies based on data-driven insights.
